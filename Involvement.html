	<p>My involvement within my community in Orono begins with my sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi. There are hundred of AOII chapters across the continental United States that benefit the Arthritis Foundation! The Gamma Chapter at the University of Maine benefits Juvenile Arthritis. Annually, AOII chapters raise money through our national fundraiser called "Strike Out Arthritis", locally, Gamma raises money through the Mr. Fraternity fundraiser, which also benefits the Juvenile Arthritis Foundation through The AOII Foundation! Being part of a sorority that has done so much for the community make me very proud to be in AOII!</p> </Body>
