	<p> My name is Emily Jordan, I was raised in Hollis, Maine; which is about a 45 minute drive southwest of Portland. I currently live in Orono, and attend the <a href="https://www.umaine.edu"> University of Maine.</a> While attending the University, I am studying International Finance and Spanish Language and Culture. </P>
	<p>My hobbies include most activities outside including kayaking, camping, fishing and hiking, which are my favorites! I have also played basketball for 13 years and it is one of my greatest passions! Living in Maine has given me many opportunities, it is a beautiful state and I absolutely love living here!</p>
